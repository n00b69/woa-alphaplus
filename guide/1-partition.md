### Backing up partitions
> If you don't do this and mess something up, you're on your own

#### Boot to EDL
- Open **Device Manager** on your PC
- With the phone turned off, hold **volume down** + **power**.
- Keep holding as it displays the unlocked bootloader warning.
- After the screen turns dark, release the **power** button while continuing to hold the **volume down** button.
- While holding the **volume down** button, start rapidly pressing the **volume up** button.
- Keep doing this until you see **QDLoader 9008** or **QUSB_BULK** in the Device Manager on your PC.
- If the device has a ⚠️ yellow warning triangle, you need to install fastboot drivers before you can continue to the next step.

#### Reboot to download mode
- Hold **volume down** + **power**.
- Keep holding as it displays the unlocked bootloader warning.
- After the screen turns dark, release the **power** button while continuing to hold the **volume up** button.
- While holding the **volume down** button, press the **volume up** button.

#### Setting up Qfil
- Open **Qfil**.
- In "Select Build Type", select **flat build**.
- In "Select programmer", select the downloaded firehose.
- In Configuration, make sure the "Device Type" is set to **UFS**.

#### Backing up your partitions
- In **Qfil**, select Tools > Partition manager, and click **Ok**.
- Right click on **laf_a** > **Manage Partition Data** and press **Read Data**.
- Do the same thing for **laf_b**, **boot_a**, **boot_b**, **abl_a**, **abl_b**, **aop_a**, **aop_b**, **xbl_a**, **xbl_b**, **ftc**, **fsg**, **fsc**, **modemst1**, **modemst2**, **modem_a**, **modem_b**

> [!Note]
> This will back up your partitions to `C:\users\name\AppData\roaming\qualcomm\qfil\comportno\`. You can restore them later with the **Load Image** function.

#### Clearing the laf partition
- In **Qfil**, select Tools > Partition manager, and click **Ok**.
- Right click on **laf_a** > **Manage Partition Data** and press **Erase**.
- Do the same thing for **laf_b**

#### Reboot your phone
> Hold **power** to reboot back to Android

#### Flash TWRP or Orange Fox
> Use the provided files and flash them in Magisk, then reboot to recovery
>
> If you have Lineage recovery, you can also use that instead

#### Unmount all partitions
Go to mount in TWRP/Orange Fox and unmount all partitions

### Preparing for partitioning
> Download the parted file and move it in the platform-tools folder, then run
```cmd
adb push parted /cache/ && adb shell "chmod 755 /cache/parted" && adb shell /cache/parted /dev/block/sda
```

#### Printing the current partition table
> Parted will print the list of partitions, **userdata** should be the last partition in the list.
```cmd
print
```

#### Removing userdata
> Replace **$** with the number of the **userdata** partition, which should be **30**
> 
> If you have a **grow** partition, remove it as well
```cmd
rm $
```

#### Recreating userdata
> Replace **19GB** with the former start value of **userdata** which we just deleted
>
> Replace **40GB** with the end value you want **userdata** to have
```cmd
mkpart userdata ext4 19GB 40GB
```

#### Creating ESP partition
> Replace **40GB** with the end value of **userdata**
>
> Replace **40.5GB** with the value you used before, adding **0.5GB** to it
```cmd
mkpart esp fat32 40GB 40.5GB
```

#### Creating Windows partition
> Replace **40.5GB** with the end value of **esp**
>
> Replace **126GB** with the end value of your disk, use `p free` to find it
```cmd
mkpart win ntfs 40.5GB 126GB
```

#### Exit parted
```cmd
quit
```

#### Format all data
Go to the Wipe menu in TWRP, press Format Data, then type `yes`.

#### Check if Android still starts
Just reboot the phone and see if Android still boots.
